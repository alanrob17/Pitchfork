# Pitchfork

Download the Pitchfork album reviews from a Sqlite database and upload the records into my ``RecordDB`` database table named ``Reviews``.

Once I have completed this task I will join the ``Review`` table with my ``Artist`` and `Record` tables to upload the Pitchfork reviews into the corresponding ``Record`` reviews.
